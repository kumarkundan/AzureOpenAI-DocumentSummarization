    "# Azure OpenAI - Progressive Document Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI's GPT-3 model affords state-of-the-art language processing capabilities to generate concise and informative summaries of longer documents. For enterprises, using the Azure OpenAI service allows users to harness this cutting edge ML technology while maintaining a strong security posture. Generating summaries of long-form text can provide meaningful insights across multiple domains, however users are currently limited in the size of text that can be summarized in a single call to OpenAI's models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook below demonstrates a \"progressive document summarization\" approach where multiple documents are recursively summarized to generate a final summary report. This is showcased by generating a summary of Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea - available in the public domain and [accessible online via the Gutenberg Project](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/164/164-h/164-h.htm). Each chapter is retrieved as a standalone document and subsequently summarized prior to generating a final \"book summary.\" Here, recursive calls are made to ensure token limits are maintained with each call to the AOAI API."

      "Pierre Aronnax, a professor from the Museum of Natural History in Paris, joins an expedition to hunt a giant narwhal in the North Pacific Ocean. After three months of searching, the crew spots the narwhal and prepares for battle. Pierre and Conseil are lost at sea after the frigate they were on collides with the narwhal. They are rescued by a submarine boat and taken to the Nautilus, a powerful submarine vessel owned by Captain Nemo. The vessel is powered by electricity and is equipped with a kitchen, bathroom, and berthroom. The passengers explore the ocean floor and a submarine forest, encountering a variety of flora and fauna. They navigate the dangerous waters of the Torres Straits and the Indian Ocean, encountering various species of fish, molluscs, and zoophytes. They pass by the reefs where Captain Cook's vessel was lost and eventually enter the Mediterranean. The Nautilus is pursued by a warship, which Nemo sinks, and the crew eventually escapes in a boat. Pierre Aronnax and his companions experience a thrilling journey under the sea, encountering a variety of sea creatures and marveling at the wonders of the ocean.\n"
